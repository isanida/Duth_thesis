The aim of this thesis was to study and simulate the movement of microorganisms, inspired by the biological organism of the amoeba (Physarum Polycephalum). For this purpose, a suitable computational model was designed and programmed , in this case the one of Cellular Automata, which is able to perform in parallel the algorithmic steps of the aforementioned algorithm. 

As mentioned above, source of inspiration for this model, has been the single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum, which is known to approximate numerous network problems via growth and adaptation of its protoplasmatic transport network, when stimulated by food sources. Thus constitutes an ideal candidate for unconventional, material-based computation. 

Afterwards, a data smoothing  approximating method of the computational model was examined, and was later compared to respectively examples of B-Spline curves computation, i.e. approximating functions that create curvature  at the data points which connect two individual functions . Due to the natural curvature enabled by B-Spline, they consist of a good candidate for approximation by collective material shrinkage mechanisms, which are performed by the microorganism. The final model was used in order to approach curve matching, provide the representation of the curves and form letters and numbers.
